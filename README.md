# Image-to-image translation

This repo contains implementations of methods for  style transfer using natural language descriptions, which allow to specify the
transformation up to the object in the image. The methods are based on [GroupViT](https://github.com/NVlabs/GroupViT) [1] and [CLIPstyler](https://github.com/cyclomon/CLIPstyler) [2].
